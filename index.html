          <p>GameMaker is a tool designed to empower you and your team to make new and innovative games 
            as well as prototype ideas in the fastest and most intuitive way possible, across multiple 
            target platforms. It is intended primarily as a tool for making 2D games - although 3D games 
            are perfectly doable - and comes with a number of tools and editors to help you realise your 
            dreams and ideas, with your final project being ported across multiple platforms from the 
            same initial base resources.</p>
          <p>For those that are new to the world of programming or who have never used any game creation 
            tool before, GameMaker offers an intuitive and easy to use GML Visual interface of actions 
            that allow you to start creating your own games very quickly using visual scripting:</p>
          <p>If you are a more experienced - or less visual - programmer, then you can use the proprietary 
            scripting language GML Code to create your games:</p>
          <p>You can even combine both and mix GML Code functions with GML Visual actions, giving you 
            a great deal of flexibility when it comes to how you write things. This is all laid out in 
            an intuitive fashion, with different aspects of your game "chaining" together in the IDE 
            to give you a unique and very visual representation of the workflow.</p>

          <p>This section of the manual contains all the information required to understand and use GML 
            Code. The runtime functions in this language can be used to create your games and is added 
            into objects from the Object Editor, although it can also be used along with GML Visual.</p>
          <p>Each event has its own tab in the editor and you can add, edit, or remove code from them 
            at any time (for more information on events see Object Events). The code itself must have 
            a basic structure and can contain resource indices, variables, functions, expressions, keywords, 
            etc. all of which are explained in the sections below. If you are a novice to programming 
            or making the switch from GML Visual, it is recommended that you start with the page on Basic 
            Code Structure and then read through all the other pages in this section, testing code from 
            each one within GameMaker itself.</p>
          <p>You can use Feather for intelligent code completion and error reporting in your GML Code 
            scripts.</p>

          <header><h2>Basic Code Structure</h2></header>

          <p>Code is written in <i>blocks</i> and a typical code block consists of a set of instructions, called 
            <span class="keyword">statements</span>, that are then interpreted by GameMaker and used to make something happen within 
            your game. That "something" can be as simple as adding 2 and 2 to get 4, or as complex as 
            making an enemy run away when their health gets below a certain value. The actual structure 
            of the program can vary greatly, depending on the functions it uses, but broken down to basics 
            it just looks like this:</p>
          <pre><code>&lt;statement>;
  &lt;statement>;
  ...</code></pre>
          <p>Statements should be separated with a ';' symbol to prevent errors with <span class="keyword">variable</span> declarations 
            and to keep your code clean and tidy, and they can consist of variable declarations, <span class="keyword">expressions</span> 
            and calls to specific functions. You can also "group" statements together as a block using 
            the curly brackets {} so that they run together, like in the following <span class="keyword">conditional</span> example:</p>
          <pre><code>if (&lt;conditional>)
  {
      &lt;statement>;
      &lt;statement>;
      ...
  }</code></pre>
          <p><span class="note">NOTE</span> The GameMaker Language will also accept <b>begin</b> and <b>end</b> instead of the curly brackets 
            {}, although this is not typically the most common way to do it:</p>
          <pre><code>if (&lt;conditional>)
  begin
    &lt;statement>;
    &lt;statement>;
      ...
  end</code></pre>
          <p>There are a number of different types of statements, expressions, conditionals and functions, 
            all of which are discussed at length in subsequent sections of the manual.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_Variable_Scope">
          <header><h2>Variables and Variable Scope</h2></header>
          
          <p>Variables are the basic unit for most programming operations. Like any programming language, 
            GML uses them.</p>
          <p>They are used to store information in the device's memory for later (or instant) use, and 
            given a name so you can refer to them in runtime and script functions.</p>
          <p>A variable in GML can store many different Data Types, like a real number (e.g.: <code>100</code>, <code>2.456575</code>, 
            <code>-56</code>, etc.), a string (e.g.: <code>"Hello world!"</code>), an integer (e.g.: <code>1</code>, <code>556</code>, <code>-7</code>), or a boolean 
            (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>), as well as other things:</p>

          <pre>
  <code>var _num = 126.4545;
  var _str = "Hello World";
  new_num = _num * 100;
  global.my_string = _str + " I said";</code></pre>

          <p>You can also use variables to hold the values returned from functions, for example:</p>

          <pre>
  <code>var _id = instance_nearest(x, y, obj_Tree);
  root = sqrt(1000);
  global.str = string_upper("Hello World");</code></pre>

          <p>So, a variable is something that we can name and use to store a value for later use in one 
            or more operations.</p>
          <p>A good "real world" example of a variable is the speed of something, e.g. the speed of a 
            car. A car's speed is clearly variable, because at some point in time the car will be standing 
            still (i.e. its speed is equal to 0), at another point in time the car will be driving (i.e. 
            its speed is greater than 0). When the car accelerates or slows down, its speed changes. 
            So it makes sense that if you want to store the car's speed in a GameMaker game that you 
            store it in a variable. In the game, you'd e.g. set the variable to 0 when the game starts 
            and change it whenever you want the car to change its speed.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="If_/_else_and_Conditional_Operators">
          <header><h2>If / else and Conditional Operators</h2></header>

          <p>A fundamental feature of most programming languages is the ability to ask a simple question 
            that gives a boolean <b>true</b> or <b>false</b> answer, and in GML this is achieved using the <b>if</b> keyword. 
            A simple <b>if</b> condition takes an <span class="keyword">expression</span> and will perform one or more <span class="keyword">statements</span> if the 
            expression resolves as true, with the following basic form:</p>

          <pre>
  <code>if (&lt;expression>)
  {
      &lt;statement>;
      &lt;statement>;
      ...
  }</code></pre>

          <p>Here you are saying that if an expression resolves to <b>true</b> then do something. Note that 
            the "then" part of the condition is <i>implicit</i>, but there is a then keyword that can be used 
            (although it's almost always omitted), so you can also create conditionals like this:</p>

          <pre>
  <code>if (&lt;expression>) then
  {
      &lt;statement>;
      &lt;statement>;
      ...
  }</code></pre>

          <p>Apart from <b>if</b> and <b>then</b>, you can also use the <b>else</b> keyword to do something else if the expression 
            being checked evaluates as <b>false</b>. This "<b>if... then... else...</b>" form looks like this:</p>
          
            <pre>
  <code>if (&lt;expression>)
  {
      &lt;statement>;
  }
  else
  {
      &lt;statement>;
  }</code></pre>

          <p>In this case the expression will be evaluated, and if it evaluates to <b>false</b>, the statement 
            after <b>else</b> is executed, otherwise the initial statement is executed (it's <b>true</b>).</p>
          <p><span class="note">NOTE</span> In the GameMaker language any value that is less than or equal to 0 will evaluate as 
            <b>false</b>, while any value that is greater than 0 will evaluate as <b>true</b>.</p>
